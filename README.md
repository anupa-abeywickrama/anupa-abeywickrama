> Self-driven. No degree. Just 2 years of building real things that actually ship.

I'm a developer from Sri Lanka who designs, builds, and ships full-stack web applications end-to-end — solo. I handle everything from system architecture and backend APIs to pixel-perfect, responsive UIs. I've also embraced AI-augmented development workflows, integrating agentic tools to move faster without cutting corners.

I'm currently building **OpenZ** — my own software company focused on crafting modern, high-quality web products.
